                        working attitude, and tight-knit solidarity. Although we are still newbies in the transition
                        from high school and we came from different educational systems, we all share the same thing
                        that we are willing to work nine-to-five and discuss overtime to come up with the best possible result.
                        By doing that, we can amend our weaknesses, thrive on our strengths as a team and we can be well-prepared
                        for work and life. Besides, if each digit in our team name is added together, it will become the time when
                        every member in our team has heard of the terms coding, programming, and Information Technology. Since then,
                        we all have had the same goal of having a job relevant to Information Technology.

                                    <p class="text-muted">Senior Front-end Developer - Skedulo Vietnam</p>
                                    <p class="large text-muted" style="margin: 20px; text-align: justify;"> Since most jobs require a bachelor's degree, my first milestone on the journey to achieve my goal is to complete the RMIT Information Technology course. Not only that, I must always keep my focus high so that I can finish the course with great results, which will eventually lead me to a better junior job. However, working only on school materials will definitely not be sufficient, which leads to my next goal: gain designing and user experience skills. <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">
                                    <br><br>My dream career is mainly in the front-end, which is responsible for the interface of a product. Therefore, I need to know the basics of what makes a pleasing and easy-to-use design. The best way I could think of is to read books or other senior tips. I could also learn by seeing the design of real-world projects. More than that, I will also need to work on my technical skills. Since I had learned quite a bit about HTML and CSS and had even developed a simple website using them, I could now concentrate on a different technology, namely JavaScript. I will learn about it through reading documentation and using online resources that are already accessible, such as Codecademy or Freecodecamp. Since JS has many frameworks, I will also need to take a look at those too. Nevertheless, technical skill is not the only thing that matters in a real-world job, but communication and networking are also an essential part of the workflow. To improve this soft skill, what better way than to utilize my time at RMIT University. I could practice my presentation skill in front of a crowd or teamwork collaboration in our school project. I could also use this time as a way to practice my time management and production workflow. 
                                    <br><br>Lastly, I cannot just join my ideal job right after school as I lack experience. Hence, working on a side project, such as my online portfolio or website, is a terrific way to gain experience. I could also try freelancing or attend an internship to have a taste of the real working experience. My journey will undoubtedly be long and tough, but I am confident that if I keep on track, I will reach my destination.

During my study, I will join clubs and competitions to gain managerial or other relevant skills as well as to enrich my knowledge. Moreover, I will search for internships during that time so that I can gain as much real-life working experience as possible to get a job as a Data Analyst after graduating. Moreover, I will spend more <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> time teaching myself new programming languages; enrolling in online courses about Marketing, Supply chain, Finance, or I will learn them as my General Electives during my time in RMIT. In addition, I will learn some new soft skills and necessary skills for my future job. After graduating, I will apply for a Data Analyst position in a local enterprise and work for a few years to have more experience and a deeper understanding.While working, I will continue to teach myself new skills as well as learn from my colleagues to thrive.  Next, I will apply for a Senior Data Analyst position in a bigger company and work for a few years more to develop my technical skills and expand my relationship network. During this time, I will attend some courses in management for my managerial skills before applying for a higher position in one of the top national or international enterprises like my ideal job.</span></p>

Most of us will gain experience and knowledge through study in RMIT, set goals for internship and gain bachelor degree to set out for jobs. All of us tried to aim for a leading role of a department or in teams, so we all have to begin as a junior developer or data analyst to gain experience and have more understanding of our basic role. Ngoc plans to have a side hustle as a freelancer or build her online portfolio to gain more experience in order to achieve her dream job. During the time in school, Thach plans to take additional online certificate courses and join clubs like finance, or marketing to expand his knowledge on economics revolve around us, which is a different kind of data that he can analyze, this will help him to progress faster. Thong will try to have hands-on experience with the system of a server or practicing in debugging and cybersecurity, the more he can understand the system and the network the better he can work his way up to manager. Luan career plan is similar to Thong because they both pursue the role of a manager, however, he aims for the role of AI project manager, he will start at machine learning developer.</p>

                                    <p class="large text-muted" style="margin: 20px; text-align: justify;"> RMIT University has always been known for having the most modern and well-equipped facilities, which is most noticeable at their Saigon South Campus. Despite the freedom of a large and well-facilitated playground, locating classes in RMIT can be incredibly troubling for new arrivals like me. Ideally, this is where the RMIT SGS app comes to play. The app offers a quick and easy navigation around the RMIT SGS campus, in which it<span id="dots5">...</span><span id="more5"> inquires both outdoor and indoor maps. Followed by that, the app can also draw up direction, display the time and distance of the journey for the user. Apart from that, all buildings and classrooms will also be labeled with a story behind them, where visitors/ students could click and learn more about RMIT campuses. Furthermore, Online Health Declaration and Timetable will also be made accessible on the app.
                                    <br><br>Aiming to provide a more enjoyable on-campus experience for everyone, the RMIT SGS app holds itself to producing a convenient and effective interface that should be mobile-friendly and approachable for every age range. Our team believes that the app could also help every student to endure better time management, which could result in a higher overall score. RMIT, on the other hand, may integrate this application with others to create an all-in-one space for both the students and staff. In which, the user could log in with their ID, and further manage their school profile (Timetable, Classes, etc.,) through the application. With everything considered, the software will undoubtedly play a supportive role to enhance the student’s university life, and possibly further improve the university's reputation.

To fill in this gap, navigation applications were created so that all of us could inquire guidance wherever we go. According to The Manifest, 77% of smartphone owners interact with a navigation application every day [1]. Amongst all, with students coming back to school after the pandemic, a navigation tool would be the<span id="dots6">...</span><span id="more6"> ideal option for them to quickly adjust back to their campus life. Along with the high demand and necessity, we have chosen to break down the RMIT campus into a navigation application so that everyone could better navigate around the RMIT campus. Besides supporting new arrivals, our team believes that the experiences gained from planning, compromising, and composing this project could be integrated further in the future, by that also help us to create a better-looking CV.</span></p>

A few familiar names are Google Maps and Apple Maps. Amongst that, there are also a few applications created by other universities such as Swinburne, where they’ve created “Swintopia” an interactive game that allows the user to go around the campus online and learn more about the history of Swinburne’s Campus. Having that said, <span id="dots7">...</span><span id="more7">there is yet to be any application specifically created for the RMIT campus. Henceforth implying a high demand for it at RMIT. Therefore, our team believes that the “RMIT SGS application” could play a significant role in improving the campus life of every RMIT-ERs.</span></p>

                         In the future, our project might be heard by a group of venture capitalists, 
                         and they are impressed that they want to fund our group to develop our project into a complete product. 
                         However, making a functional, successful application requires a lot of steps, and working as a team is 
                         extremely crucial to complete that process and bring our project to the next level. Therefore, we need a 
                         team of four people in charge of four different tasks. Firstly, in order to develop an application, 
                         we need a User Experience/ User Interface Developer (UI/UX Developer) to take care of the tasks related 
                         to the application building process. Furthermore, the UI/UX Developer in our team also needs to have some 
                         necessary skills like great teamwork skills, user research skills, great passion and the ability to think 
                         innovatively since the interface of the application will determine the users’ emotions and satisfaction toward 
                         the application. This is a very important aspect of building <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">and an application because if the interface is designed 
                         intelligently for the users to accomplish their goals easily, it will enhance the users’ satisfaction. Furthermore, 
                         this person also needs to have a set of hybrid skills are programming and designing, the UI/UX Developer needs to 
                         have a deep understanding of C, C++, and Java to develop the application for Apple, Android, and Windows-based 
                         devices besides understanding what the users will expect from an excellent application. The UI/UX Developer 
                         to make our application’s interface look more aesthetically delightful to impress the users. Moreover, this 
                         person needs to have a deep interpretation of typography, color palettes, visual touchpoints, imagery, and 
                         animations in order to complete that besides having a set of skills including teamwork experience, innovative 
                         thinking, passionate and having a great understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete the interface of 
                         the application. The second position is a Software Security Engineer, this is a significantly important position 
                         in our team since we will use a lot of information databases from RMIT University and our application needs a high 
                         level of security so that the users’ information will not be stolen and our application will not be hacked. In addition, 
                         this person will also be the back-end developer of our project. Ultimately, the Software Security Engineer in our team 
                         needs to be familiar with using C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP, SQL, and Scala to prevent malware and hackers 
                         as well as manage the database and the server of the application. Besides, it is necessary for this person to be 
                         collaborative, innovative, and passionate in order to work with the UI/UX Developer to complete the application. 
                         The third position in our team is a Data Analyst, this is a vital role in our team since this job role will be the 
                         one that will analyze the data from the feedback, the tests, the customers, and more. It is crucial for the Data Analyst 
                         in our team to have a high sense of responsibility, great passion for work, innovative thinking, and teamwork experience.
                         Furthermore, the Data Analyst in our team is required to have a set of skills such as great managerial skills and great 
                         analytical skills since this person will be in charge of analyzing a huge amount of data, managing the project, and 
                         connecting to the whole team together. Besides, this person needs to have great technical skills like Python, SQL, 
                         Scala, and data visualization tools like Power BI, Tableau since these are compulsory tools for Data Analysts. The 
                         final position of our team is the Project Manager, this is a significantly crucial position of our team since this 
                         person will be the representative of the team to deal with the paperwork and this person will connect our team. The 
                         Project Manager in our team will need great managerial skills, good representation skills and this person has to be 
                         well-organized, collaborative, innovative, and passionate. All in all, although four different positions require 
                         distinctive skills, we all have the same big goal is to bring our project to the next level and people can have a 
                         comfortable experience while using it.

                                <p class="large text-muted" style="margin: 20px; text-align: justify;">Within a team-oriented setting, our team has thrived through and produced an incredibly desirable outcome. Personally, I think that I have done quite well filling in the role of a team leader. Apart from supporting each other, our team never forgot to communicate with each other. The power of communication has allowed us to become incredibly time-efficient, despite being assigned different roles. Having that said, I think that <span id="dots8">...</span><span id="more8">our team could further improve on structuring group meetings. As oftentimes we all tend to think on the spot, rather than preparing the ideas beforehand. This unrecognized mistake has caused our team a lot of time, and therefore, interrupting the project’s timeline. Luckily, our group was able to overcome these issues quite quickly before the deadline. Overall, I find the experience to be incredibly enjoyable and insightful. Amongst acquiring new connections, I was also able to learn a lot from my teammates. By overcoming all the obstacles together, I think that the most important thing that I’ve learned was to listen. As every single one of us has got a unique play of mind, and it would be incredibly unfortunate to miss out on any of them.

                                <p class="large text-muted" style="margin: 20px; text-align: justify;"> Our team members were very collaborative, energetic, and supportive. Although each of us was assigned different tasks, we all supported each other whenever our teammate needed it. All in all, every individual in our team has contributed a lot to our group project and I think I have completed my parts quite well. However, if there was something to improve, it would be my starting time to have more time working on our group <span id="dots9">...</span><span id="more9">project. If I had started doing our group project sooner, I would have had more time to amend my parts and support my teammates. The thing that surprised me the most is our workflow because it is surprisingly smooth, every member in our team always stayed on top of the deadline and finished the assigned parts in time. Besides, our team’s solidarity was very impressive, every member was thoughtful, caring, and supportive to the rest. In addition, my teammates were very knowledgeable about many fields. I have learned a lot of technical and real-life knowledge from my teammates so that I can amend my weaknesses and I have improved my teamwork skills for collaborating more effectively.</span></p>

                                <p class="large text-muted" style="margin: 20px; text-align: justify;"> If I have to describe my team in simple words, I would say “Great Chemistry”. From the start of our project, the team jumped straight to the task allocating phase, and everything went smoothly, proving that each of us had a great comprehension of each other's abilities and skills. After going through the previous assignment, we have gotten used to the working style of each member in the team, therefore our progress and <span id="dots10">...</span><span id="more10">timing of each task as well as collaborating operation has gone smoothly, leading to a desirable outcome of our project. 
                                <br><br>However, there is still one aspect that we may be able to improve in the future. From the beginning of the assignment, our team has skipped the part which is extremely important. There should be a meeting at the beginning of the assignment for all of us to unified our ideas and plan out the general roadmap for our project. Even though our team has great chemistry and great understanding of each other, the miscommunication of the project plan has somehow slowed down our process by a lot. 
                                <br><br>In the span of our last assignment, what has surprised me the most has further surprised me even more in this project. The more I work with my teammates, the more I learn about their skills and abilities and I cannot help but be surprised about how talented my teammate is. For example, I have known that Thach is a fast-learner, but in this assignment, he also proved that he is a responsible teammate who keeps finishing his tasks early so that he can re-read and improve his work even more. Moreover, he is also the member who keeps reminding other team members to concentrate on their work in order to finish on time.

I felt I did my parts well, I have worked on the role of each person in our group. In this part, I carefully divide each person for the role that can show the best of their personality and also the skills they are currently using in order to develop it.  Next is the <span id="dots11">...</span><span id="more11">presentation. At first, it was hard for me to construct the outline of the PowerPoint but after times, I managed to do it. What needs to be improved must be the risks part. Because the range of this project is wide, I cannot clearly state out the risks. So that I can only write out some of the most clear risks that I can think of.  First time doing this kind of project, there are limitless surprises that I come across. The most remarkable thing is how great our teams work together. The way we communicate and the meetings we attend are great and that boosts up a lot of our overall progress. During the project, I learnt one thing: how we can point out each other's flaws and from that, we discuss with each other and develop our mind from that. In this GitHub audit trail, I did not engage in that part much so there is likely no astonishing activity that I can show here.</span></p>

Most of us will gain experience and knowledge through study in RMIT, set goals for internship and gain bachelor degree to set out for jobs. All of us tried to aim for a leading role of a department or in teams, so we all have to begin as a junior developer or data analyst to gain experience and have more understanding of our basic role. Ngoc plans to have a side hustle as a freelancer or build her online portfolio to gain more experience in order to achieve her dream job. During the time in school, Thach plans to take additional online certificate courses and join clubs like finance, or marketing to expand his knowledge on economics revolve around us, which is a different kind of data that he can analyze, this will help him to progress faster. Thong will try to have hands-on experience with the system of a server or practicing in debugging and cybersecurity, the more he can understand the system and the network the better he can work his way up to manager. Luan career plan is similar to Thong because they both pursue the role of a manager, however, he aims for the role of AI project manager, he will start at machine learning developer.</p>

I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City. I am currently a first-year student at RMIT University, and my student ID is s3924496. With a strong passion for technology, I am currently pursuing an Information Technology degree at this university. When it comes to languages, I am fluent in Vietnamese (my mother tongue) and English. In my leisure time, I like volunteering for charitable organizations. One of the charitable activities I have taken part in is the United Minds Mindlight Project, in which I taught English and life skills to visually impaired students at Nguyen Dinh Chieu school. Aside from that, I have celebrated a moon festival for the orphans at Mai Am Anh Sang (District 3, HCMC) and helped in delivering charity meals to the lonely disabled and homeless elderly in HCMC. Apart from my interest in charitable activities, I also love cooking and reading detective books. About my high school background, I used to be a loyal member of the school's Robotics Club, and I was also joining many web-designing classes. Thanks to that, I was able to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS and became interested in the job of Front-end Developer. Beyond that, I have also created a website using WordPress. (Here is my website <a href="https://snuffbox.000webhostapp.com" target="_blank">link</a>).</p>

In the near future, I intend to learn more about JavaScript by reading the documentation and using online resources such as Codecademy or Freecodecamp. To obtain additional experience, I plan to work on a side project, such as my online portfolio or website, or try freelancing and attend an internship to have a feel of the real working experience. My journey will undoubtedly be long and tough, but I am confident that if I keep on track, I will reach my destination.</p>

I am an RMIT freshman, my student ID is s3927021 and currently, I am studying for the Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born in Ho Chi Minh city, and I have been living here since. When it comes to languages, I can speak Vietnamese and English because those are compulsory languages in Vietnam’s educational program. However, I had learned Simplified Chinese for a few months before the first outburst of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, I am an active person, so I love playing sports and playing basketball, swimming, and working out at the gym are my favorite ones. Furthermore, I love travelling, listening to V-pop and US-UK music to be more precise, and I love cooking. I find it very interesting to be creative in making my food. About pets, I would love to have a Siberian Husky and fishes as my pets because I find a Siberian Husky very cute, and watching the fishes swimming in the tank can be very relaxing and satisfying although I only have a fish tank at home currently and I hope to have a Siberian Husky soon. I find Data Science very intriguing in IT because data appears everywhere, and it plays a vital role in many enterprises. My interest in IT commenced when I was still a senior student in high school. After taking further research on Data Science, I made up my mind to choose my career as a Data Analyst to embark on after graduating from university. Although I am just a freshman and I have not had any professional or IT-related experience, I will do my best as a student. I am going to finish my study at RMIT University as a Bachelor of Information Technology with a minor in Data Analytics. During my study, I will join clubs, competitions, and online courses to gain relevant skills as well as to enrich my knowledge about Supply chain, Finance, Marketing, etc. Moreover, I will search for internships during that time so that I can gain as much real-life working experience as possible to get a job as a Data Analyst after graduating. </p>

My friends always describe me as a funny and down-to-earth person, but I think it just because gravity pulled me down. I must say that I have a lot of skills in different field from sports to academic, however, due to the fact that I learned too much, I was never an expert in any aspects. Currently, I am practicing piano to add to my collection of “skills-that-no-one-admired” and also to fulfill my dream of playing my own favorite music instead of listening to it on the internet. </p>

When I was in grade 7, I got a chance to attend a summer camp in Singapore, which is a great experience of mine as I was able to acquired useful skills like English speaking or presentation skills. In 2020, I was selected to be in the robotic team, representing the Cong Hoa campus in the SIU Open technology competition. After two days of hard-working, our team won the third place in the competition.</p>

I have three dogs which were all white, one of them is the first ever dog that I owned as pet and it was a little bit grumpy towards the other two, my favorite one is the poodle because it is the only one that allow me to pick up. Another hobby of mine is video games, I have been playing mobile video games for most of my life, which is a waste of time as everyone knows that gaming on a computer is much better. </p>

I have graduated from Faith West Academy located in Texas, U.S. I have studied abroad in America for four years so I am very much confident in my speaking skill. During the time in high school, I have been basketball team for one year, participated in school soccer teams for two years, ran for track and field in 100m dash, 400m dash in the first year, 300m hurdles for the second year, and finally, I was in the skeet shooting team for two years. In my free time, I am quite investing in gaming, especially in the FPS genre (First Person Shooter). There was one time, when the first wave of the COVID-19 virus hit America, all the school switch to online classes, I was having a lot of times after finishing up homework and we could not really go outside, so I sticked with the computer most of the times and grinding the game, to the point that I was in a semi-competitive environment with an actual team and working on strategy and review gameplay, etc. Other times I will watch anime or workout. My interest in IT sparked when I was watching a YouTuber named Joma Tech, he is also an ex data scientist for Facebook and software engineer at Google. He has a video which is called “What really is Data Scientist? Told by a Data Scientist”. He explained how data scientists originate from the history of data mining and how companies use big data to expand their possibility of growth, achievement, and optimization for consumers. I watched his video and found the job and the future of the information store in the network can make many different things. This gives me the inspiration to research more about software and IT professionals. During my time studying at RMIT, I expect to expand my knowledge in the IT world. Having to solve real world problems that I might encounter during my journey, develop discipline and techniques can lift myself up during challenging times. I hope I can learn more soft skills and hardware knowledge that will contribute to my profession. </p>

Our group has divided the assignment into two main tasks which are the information for the report and the code for the website together with the prototype of our group project idea. First of all, Luan and Thong were assigned with researching, finding, and writing the report since they are excellent content writers with advanced words and accurate grammar usage. Moreover, Luan and Thong used Google Docs in order to cooperate and they could keep track of their counterpart’s progress easier. In addition, Thach and Ngoc can also observe their working process so that Thach and Ngoc can support and give some feedback to Thong and Luan to improve the report. The next major task of the assignment is the website and the prototype of our group project idea, which was assigned to Thach and Ngoc. More specifically, Thach took care of compiling the Team Profile, Tools, Project Description Overview, and the References parts into HTML and CSS to upload that information to the group website while Ngoc was working on the compilation of the Detailed Project Description, Group Reflection, Skills, and Jobs parts into HTML together with using CSS and JavaScript to make our website more spectacular, eye-catching and more interactive. During the process, Thach and Ngoc used GitHub in order to upload all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes of the website to our Git Repository so that the whole group could observe their workflow easier. Not only that, but everyone including users outside of our project can also access our work since we have published it to GitHub. Additionally, Thach and Ngoc have worked together on Figma to create and complete the prototype of our group project idea so that people outside of our project could visualize its interface and functionality.</p>

                                    <hr class="name_line" style = "height:8px">
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/1.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 1. What does it do? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">It is undeniable that privacy had been one of the most vital issues among people, businesses, and organizations even before the “digital big bang”. However, since the early days after the revolutionary invention of the computer and the arrival of the Internet, information security had become more important but more vulnerable and fragile since the information was transmitted to a digital platform instead of being in physical shape like before. Therefore, the term “Cybersecurity” had arrived, and it became the key to protecting and maintaining privacy, users’ assets, and classified information. In 2020, V. Michael and B. Ian noted in their book that cybersecurity covers a wide range of social and technical problems that must be taken into consideration to secure networked information systems and network privacy [1].  In addition, in 2021, according to A. Moallem, “Cybersecurity is a growing field of science composed of very diverse types of technologies used to protect systems from different kinds of attacks, some known and some unknown. Due to the complexity of the evolving aspects of these areas, there is no standard classification of protective technologies.” [2, p. 1].</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">The traditional approach of security to protect computer systems and network systems like authentication devices, firewalls, and virtual private networks (VPN) has a lot of different kinds of vulnerabilities since cyberattacks nowadays have become more advanced and sophisticated and they can disrupt security programs and infiltrate systems [3]. In the upcoming years, it is critical and escalating compulsory for companies and organizations to deal with complexity since the sprawling increase of today’s network scale is inevitable and clear borders, access points will be eliminated; IT teams can reach the point of exhaustion from relentless sprint of protecting information; more importantly, the volume of data will rise dramatically, which can give cybercriminals more thing to exploit, and “complexity is the enemy of security” [4]. Therefore, different technologies must be applied and integrated to upgrade cybersecurity so that it can resist modern cyberattacks.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Nowadays, as technology is growing rapidly, many existing tools and technologies can be used to enhance cybersecurity. There are two ways of categorizing cybersecurity technologies. The first way is based on the components that each technology is supposed to protect which are network, application, endpoint, data, identity, database, infrastructure, mobile, cloud, and backup [2, p.25]. The second way is the solution-based classification including Identity and Access Management, Risk and Compliance Management, Encryption, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Unified Threat Management (UTM), Firewall, Antivirus/ Anti-malware Solutions, Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/ Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Disaster Recovery, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Mitigation and Web filtering [2, p. 25].</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Moreover, some specific technologies can be optimized for information protection. Firstly, data encryption is a very powerful way to protect confidential information from hackers. Moreover, this technology uses a symmetric-key algorithm and asymmetric-key algorithm such as Blowfish and RSA, respectively, to encode the sensitive data to meaningless language and this encoded data is only readable by the person having the decryption key [2, p. 30]. Secondly, biometric technology has developed significantly since it uses physical and behavioral traits which are permanent and unique for authentication, surveillance, and identification instead of conventional passwords, which is a very safe and reliable approach [2, p. 50]. Thirdly, firewall technology has been widely implemented in hardware and software from personal devices to large data systems in companies and organizations. In detail, a firewall is a network security system designed to monitor traffic to and from a computer or computer network and to block traffic that does not comply with security parameters in place so that it can protect a computer or computer network from cyberattacks [5]. In addition, malware protection technology is indispensable due to the proliferation of smart technologies and malware can be a significant threat. For instance, there were a lot of infamous malware attacks in the past like Stuxnet Worm (2010), Backoff (2014), or WannaCry Ransomware (2017), etc [2, p. 102-103]. Therefore, anti-malware solutions must be constantly conducted to detect and prevent malware from stealing confidential information. Finally, as we are living in a world of expanding connectivity, the Internet of Things technology will be a great cybersecurity approach. Moreover, IoT technologies connect all devices and make them “smart” by connecting them to other devices in a network and “intelligent” by using machine learning and data science to manage and analyze real data to make decisions and predict future events [2, p. 116]. In the future, as newer technologies will be introduced and developed, cybersecurity will implement those latest technologies to protect data and information.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 2. What is the likely impact? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">It is undeniable that cybersecurity will become an indispensable industry as the technology era continues to rise sharply. Thanks to cybersecurity, companies, organizations, or users, in general, will be more confident of information security and it may change how people think about information security. Furthermore, the concept of environmentalism will become ubiquitous among users since this is “a concept where humans believe in the responsibility to protect the planet and where norms of behavior have been established, nurtured, and generally followed.” [4, p. 284]. However, what we need in the technology era is “cyberspace environmentalism” [4, p. 284], which is a set of shared beliefs, norms, and shared experiences among people about the culture of security.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">As a result, IT teams will not have to sprint endlessly to keep the data secured like before but then they have to come up with different approaches using a combination of different technologies like Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence models and algorithms, etc to make cybersecurity systems more adaptive and keep the information systems safe from not only the old versions of cyberattacks but also the latest ones. According to Ken Xie, the CEO of Fortinet, “There is virtually no area of cybersecurity that will not be transformed by AI and ML.” [4, p. 282] and Michael Xie, a president and the CTO of Fortinet, has claimed that “We must move from threat prevention to the greater challenge of securing hyperconnectivity.”</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">As the cybersecurity industry will need to implement various technologies, a diversity of professions will be in demand. For instance, if Machine Learning is adopted into cybersecurity, it will create some jobs in the Machine Learning field that specializes in cybersecurity or there will be cooperating activities between many teams to come up with approaches using different technologies. As a result, not only the information and data will become more secure, but tight-knitted solidarity will be built among teams in a company or an organization. On the contrary, there will be some old technologies will no longer be the main efforts in protecting the data, but they will become a part of the latest cybersecurity systems.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 3. How will this affect you? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">From my perspective, not only cybersecurity helps large-scale companies and organizations, but it also makes daily users like me and my family more confident about information security. Although there will not be a lot of changes in the way I use technology since modern cybersecurity systems will be built inside of hardware and software. I must admit that I use technology every day mainly for educational and entertaining purposes and it is becoming an indispensable part of my daily life because of its diverse conveniences and benefits. Thanks to the latest versions of cybersecurity systems that implement various new technologies, I can feel more secure and confident using technology without worrying too much about whether my personal information will be leaked, or my devices will be hacked into.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">From my view of a technology daily user, there will be some major differences between the current cybersecurity systems and the newer ones in the future. I believe the newer versions can detect more malware, phishing, and threats in general although the current versions can only detect limited threats. As a result, I can have a more comfortable experience using technology or surfing the web since if there are any hidden threats detected during my usage, there will be warnings showing up and the cybersecurity systems will stop those threats. In addition, these newer versions of cybersecurity systems can be a significant assistant for my family members and friends, who do not have a deep interpretation of technology and threats, so they can lose their personal information without knowing it. Since the cybersecurity systems will be more adaptive, they can have a smoother experience using technology without being interrupted with malware or spam emails while working and entertaining, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and safety protocols must be followed, people can be more confident of their data security, and they can do their work from home more effectively.</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Internet of Things</h2>
                                    <hr class="name_line" style = "height:8px">
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/2.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 1. What does it do? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">It has been more than a decade since the phrase “Internet of Things” was first described by Kevin Ashton, a co-founder and executive director of the Auto-ID center, to reduce human workload in 1999 [6]. According to F. Xia, L. T. Yang, L. Wang, and A. Vinel, the Internet of Things refer to the networked interconnection of everyday objects, which are often equipped with ubiquitous intelligence and it will increase the ubiquity of the Internet by integrating every object for interaction through embedded systems, which leads to a highly distributed network of devices communicating with human beings as well as other devices [7]. Since then, IoT has become the future trend that most technologies are being developed around it.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Nowadays, IoT has appeared everywhere from conventional industries like healthcare, education, industrial manufacturing to modern industries using cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, cryptocurrencies, automation, and many more. The Internet of Things makes everything smarter and more helpful to our daily lives. For instance, recently, thanks to the Internet of Things, citizens can have a deeper understanding of the trend “smart homes” and they can experience it in person. In detail, smart homes, an application of IoT, are those where household devices can be monitored and controlled remotely, which can ease out the home automation task [8]. Moreover, “With the upcoming technologies like the IoT— both consumer and industrial— artificial intelligence, robotics, and evolving machine learning provides an open environment where potential business partners and their machines can collaborate and exchange information over a digitally connected network using cyber physical systems.” [9, p. 154].</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">During the COVID-19 pandemic and many safety protocols must be followed, the Internet of Things can be the key factor to make our lives better in the future. For example, there is a potential trend called “IoT-Based Smart Tourism” that can be applied to the reality that can help tourism to recover and rise again since this industry has been heavily damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to W. Wang et al., “Efficient data transmission based on 5G technology and smart data processing based on AI technology are significant to unlocking IoT-based smart tourism applications” [10]. In addition, this technology can be taken even further and on a larger scale to turn such complex visions like smart cities into reality. Furthermore, R. Ramakrishnan and L. Gaur have claimed that “The IoT of today will extend to cover process, people, products, and other infrastructure to become Internet of Everything (IoE), thereby streamlining the manufacturing process.” [9, p. 154-155]. Moreover, IoT can be developed to make virtual worlds like the Metaverse that Facebook is doing which can be a turning point during the pandemic.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">However, in order to upgrade and bring the Internet of Things to the next level, there are some more compulsory technologies and developments. Firstly, 5G technology is considered to be the most important upgrade that can help humans access more advanced technologies as it is far faster and more effective than recent 4G. According to J. Pisarov and G. Mester, “5G has brought three new aspects – higher speed, lower latency, and connection of multiple devices both as sensors and IoT devices” [11] and “Like other networks, 5G uses the cells system which separates territories into sectors and sends encoded signals between the hotspots using radio waves. Each cell must be connected to the network spine, whether wirelessly or through landlines. 5G works on higher frequencies than 4G, generally on two types of frequencies: bellow and above 6 GHz.” [11]. However, to reach the full potential of 5G technology, technology companies and organizations need an extra period of time for further research and development. Secondly, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are also necessary for IoT to grow since those two fields can make complex things more automated and simpler. In addition, when working with a huge volume of data since larger scale projects will be made, scientists and researchers will need assistance from Data Science.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 2. What is the likely impact? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">It is clear that the Internet of Things is becoming more and more vital and its impact on industries, organizations and our daily lives is inevitably huge, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, IoT combining with other technologies like Artificial Intelligence and 5G can be used to build from home automation, autonomous vehicles to smart cities. As a result, the quality of our lives will be sharply increased and there will be less pollution since exhaust fumes and waste will be strictly managed. Secondly, IoT can improve the supply chain, logistics, and other industries more efficiently by providing more detailed and up-to-date information, which can help companies to come up with more specific and more effective plans to increase their revenue [12]. Thirdly, in the healthcare industry, IoT sensors can be placed inside health monitoring equipment so that the patients’ health statistics can be updated frequently on the Internet for doctors, nurses, and even their families so that the treatment process and methodology will be improved considerably [13]. In addition, as more appliances will become smarter and well-managed by IoT systems, the consumed amount of energy and natural resources will drop, and it will save the environment from pollution and natural resources exhaustion. Most importantly, since the concept of the Internet of Things is interconnectivity, the cybersecurity systems should be generously invested, frequently updated and maintained to prevent personal information leakage, hackers, malwares, etc.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">As the coverage of the Internet of Things will get larger over time, there will be more jobs available for people. For instance, technical jobs like developers, engineers that are relevant to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Cybersecurity, and so on will be in high demand. Besides, it is necessary for people doing non-technical jobs to know more about the relevant technologies since they will use those technologies every day in their work. However, there will be fewer opportunities for uneducated or less-educated workers since automation will take over jobs requiring manual labour.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 3. How will this affect you? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">From my perspective, as a student, I am experiencing a few aspects of the Internet of Things in my daily life. For instance, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students have been studying online through many platforms like Canvas, Microsoft Teams, etc. The Internet of Things has supported my studies with online video conferences so that I can join online lectures, ask questions to lecturers, and have nearly the same experience as face-to-face lectures. Besides, there are some other applications that I have experienced as a student such as online health declaration before going to the campus instead of paper declaration, attending online workshops, doing online tests, etc. Therefore, the Internet of Things will improve my daily life considerably and it will change people’s lives if it reaches its full potential. Moreover, there will be a lot of my household appliances will be automated and remotely controlled via the Internet. In addition, since self-drive vehicles will become ubiquitous and the vehicle systems will be kept up-to-date and well managed online, I will no longer experience rush hours and traffic congestions, especially in big cities of Vietnam, which can also reduce a significant amount of carbon dioxide emission to the environment.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">The Internet of Things will also provide great support for my family and friends. For instance, household chores will be well done by automated machines which will be controlled online, and family members can have more time for their work and taking care of themselves. Since information will be moved online, my family members can work directly from home. In addition, my friends, university students, can also have a better learning experience, especially those who have to be self-isolated, and they can have the same learning experience as other students. In addition, as the IoT sensors can be compressed into people devices that they use and their health statistics will be constantly updated on the Internet, my family members and my friends can freely keep track of their health and if anything unfortunate happens, it will automatically send emergency signals to hospitals and other family members, so that person can be saved in time. As a result, the Internet of Things can be significantly and undeniably helpful for everyone in society.</p>

                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 1. What does it do? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">In the vast world of IT, It is undeniable that Blockchain is the newest amongst the trend of evolving technologies. The discussion about this rising technology has been around recently as Metaverse has been introduced to people worldwide. To define the term “Blockchain technology”, Peter Mell stated in the article of Blockchain Technology Overview: “Blockchains are tamper evident and tamper resistant digital ledgers implemented in a distributed fashion usually without a central authority” [14]. Furthermore, Blockchain are defy as a decentralized transaction and data management technology in 2016 by Jesse Yli-Huumo [15]. In simple words, Blockchain are a technology where all the changes (codes, transactions, information,…) are resistant to tampering. By having no intermediary between transactions and using cryptography, information stored in a block of a blockchain will not be changed or modified by any of the sides.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Blockchain technology was discovered in 2008 along with the birth of Bitcoin. Since then, The technology was mostly linked to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. However, with the rise of Bitcoin and the debut of Metaverse, Blockchain technology are on the rise to be one of the most well-known and dominant IT technologies in the future. As of now, Blockchain are being implied into different industries and become more and more useful to the world. Some applications of Blockchain that are worth mentioned are cryptocurrency, money transferring and most recently, Metaverse.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Currently, Blockchain is being in the phase where it is getting introduced to the audiences and users and is also being developed to become a worldwide sensations/trends. Meta are one of the leading company in bringing Blockchain application into more industries and getting people to be familiar to the technologies.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">In the working of a blockchain, An input was modified by a technique called hashing. Sandeep Kumar Panda implies that with hashing, with an input type of whether text, file or image, the output is a fixed size alpha-numeric string [16]. With hashing, Blockchain allow users to transfer data without worry of being changed or tampered. The data which has been hashed will be stored in a block and users need to have a key to access the block. However, the block can only be accessed and cannot be modified or changed. When a person wants to make change to a block, they will have to create another the block which will stored all their modified data. Therefore, the old data will stay untouched.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Due to its security and decentralized features, Blockchain is not only used in just cryptocurrencies but also every transactions that are available online vary from renting a car, online voting to buying real estate and governance. Most recently, Blockchain has been announced to be used in the newest virtual world of Metaverse where people can live in with an avatar of themselves and do every trades/transactions and a wide range of other activities through blockchain technology.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px; font-style:italic;">“In general, the most common attraction of the blockchain is cryptocurrency (digital money). Nevertheless, research analysts from the government sector, corporate organizations, security institution as well as industrial segment are able to extend the potential of blockchain and its interests well beyond the domain of cryptocurrencies.” </p>
                                    <p style="text-align: right; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 70px; font-style:italic;">Ahmad Firdaus, “The rise of “blockchain”: bibliometric analysis of blockchain study”, 2019</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">With a rapid rising of popularity and usability, blockchain is surely one a promising technology of the future and will play a major role in the future society.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 2. What is the likely impact? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">The impact to humanity of this feature is expected to be massive. Not to mention the changes in other industries, the rising of Bitcoin, Etherium and the NFT, cryptocurrency industry alone is enough to make an impact on the whole world. As a person who always spend time on social media, I am able to witness the rate of appearance of Blockchain discussions are increasing rapidly in the last few years which implies the fact that more and more people are getting interested in Blockchain. Moreover, human life and society are set to be through a massive change as the Metaverse are aiming to change the way human society are functioning. As for now, there has been multiple bloom of various industry in the Metaverse. For example, real estate companies are using the Metaverse platform to run their business or some artworks are being sold on using Blockchain as an NFT. Other than the platform of metaverse, Blockchain technology are being used to protect transactions and record the process for a numerous amount of companies. One of an easy example of blockchain is the personal identity security. According to a report by Sam Daley, approximately 16 million Americans has been suffered with identity fraud and theft in 2017 [17] . However, with the application of Blockchain to store people’s identity, the rate has been reduce drastically. Another usage of Blockchain that are being used more and more by companies is the tracking of logistic works. With Blockchain, the tracking of items’ movement will be unchanged and it will help product providers to scan through the logistic process easier when a problem happens.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 3. How will this affect you? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">In my personal perspective, I have not had much experience in the field of cryptocurrency or Blockchain. However, the vast usability and benefit that it provide has attracted me to learn more about the field. Currently, I am learning about cryptocurrency and Blockchain to help me adapt to the trends of fast changing IT industry and the rise of Metaverse. For the last few months, the knowledge of Blockchain has changed my perspective about the both the future and my personal plans. The benefits and fun of blockchain are pushing me to become a blockchain developers which allow me to dive deep into the world of Metaverse and cryptocurrency. Moreover, since I heard about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Etherium, I have been told that it is bad and are capable of ruining people’s life. However, after studying about cryptocurrencies including the risks and benefits of it, I have practically change my thought about the industry. From that, I can see that I will be studying more about the technology, aiming for a good amount of knowledge about the technology in the future.</p>

                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 1. What does it do? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">The phrase Artificial Intelligence have been used since the 1950s. However, it was not until the 1980 that this term become commonly used. In a simple definition, Artificial Intelligence is the ability that allow computer to process tasks that are similar to human or represent what human are capable of. “If you can put knowledge into a program, then this program must be an AI program”, Roger C. Schank, 1987 [18] . To be more specific, a code are made to solve problems from simple to complex, a simple code solve the problem by follow the guidance of a coder. On the other hand, AI used the technique that are code by the programmers to learn and develop a solution for the problem.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">AI are also divided into three main types which commonly known as artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence and artificial super intelligence. For artificial narrow intelligence (also known as weak AI), the programmed AI are capable of doing task in one specific field. The artificial general intelligence, on the other hand, are able to perform a much more complicated task which required multiple knowledge from different field. There was a AI robot named Sofia which take the internet by storm by the way it looks and the way it gained a citizenship in Saudi Arabia, the program that made up the intelligence of the robot is what considered as artificial general intelligence (strong AI). The third type of AI – artificial super intelligence – which is also known as Super AI have not been well-implemented into the real world as it is still in developing phase. However, super AI are hoped to be able to complete tasks that human has never been done and its work will be way greater than what humanity are capable of. With the creation of super AI, humanity will be able to reach a greater achievement.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Nowadays, AI are being used in most of people’s life, its usage are numerous with functionalities vary from personal assistant to even managing a production chain in a factory. A close example of it is the personal assistant that most people interact with everyday is the personal assistant which is a built-in function in people’s phone, computer,…. Even though personal assistants are not common in Vietnam, it has been widely used around the world for a long period of time. Some famous personal assistants are Google assistant, Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">As the demand for AI in daily life are increasing drastically, it is inevitable that AI will become the dominant topic and technology in the near future. As everyone has noticed, AI has already been used in many industries and are spreading more into more fields. However, AI only capable of doing a portion of all the tasks humanity are handling, which create a goal for all AI developers and the AI field to create an AI that can reach a level of intelligence that are capable of completing complex task and be able to take over human’s work, lessening the pressures and works on people’s shoulder.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 2. What is the likely impact? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">AI has been a hot topic and the goal for companies to aim for in a creation of their new products. With that, AI is set to be implied into people’s daily life and is going to be indispensable from human’s life in the future. With AI, human will be capable of doing difficult tasks and solving complex problems. Moreover, AI will reduce labor in many industrialized countries, replacing them with a better working force with. With the help of AI, companies are going to be boosted in their productions and expand their income rates. However, the downside of this, which was predicted several times in the past by the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, is that with the rise of AI, there will be a chance that most human work will be took over by AI, therefore creating a habit of relying on AI. Also, with the AI taking over the work of human, a numerous amount of worker will lose their job which will create labor shortages in several countries, harming that nation economically.</p>

I have been enthusiastic about AI for a long time and that is also the reason why I chose to study at RMIT. Therefore, seeing the rise of AI does bring joy to me. Moreover, with AI evolving rapidly, both my and other people’s life will be affected in a good way. For example, our daily routine will be completed much quicker thanks to the help of AI such as making a cup of coffee or doing chores. For me, owning a smart home has been a dream of my own since I was young, and by having to inherit the development of the technology, it will be much easier for me to reach the desired life that I have been aiming for.</p>

It is the most important step in our plan as we need approval to run this project smoothly. If the school’s board does not approve the proposal, it will be a big issue for us as we need a platform such as RMIT website or an organization backing us to publish the application online. To complete this step, we need to organize a meeting with the school administration and carefully prepare a presentation that is appealing enough to draw their interest and approve our proposal.</p>                                    
                                    <h6 style="text-align:left; margin-left:10px;">Tools:</h6>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Needless to say, every IT project requires specific tools for the production. That is why our team will assign a person in charge of finding the most suitable tools and find the best deal possible for those tools if it requires a payment before using. For our products, there are some parts of production that need specific tools:</p>
                                    <ul style="text-align:left">
                                        <li>UI/design : Flutter, Figma, InVision Studio, Axure, Adobe XD</li>
                                        <li>UX: XCode, Android Studio</li>
                                        <li>Map API: Google Map (outdoor), MapWiz (indoor)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h6 style="text-align:left; margin-left:10px;">Prototype:</h6>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">This is the step where we will make our first prototype for the application, which requires both coding skills and designing skills from our team. The complete prototype will be tested by our team together with school administration, polishing our product so that the outcome will be the best version of it. After that, this prototype will be used for beta testing.</p>
                                    <h6 style="text-align:left; margin-left:10px;">Tester’s satisfaction:</h6>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">This goal of our team is considered one of the most important goals that we are aiming to achieve. As our product is for social use, we really valued users' feedback as well as their satisfaction. Therefore, it is a mission of our test to ensure the final product, which is used by users, is the best version, giving them the best experience using our app. To achieve this, besides the internal tests that we conduct regularly, there will be the phase where we will conduct a beta test in which some volunteers will be the testers of our prototype and eventually giving feedback, which we will use to polish our prototype for the final product.</p>
                                    <h6 style="text-align:left; margin-left:10px;">Publishing:</h6>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">The final steps that we will take to bring our product to RMIT students are the publishing progress. As our product is an app, there will be three methods that we are planning to use to publish our product: App Store, Google Play and RMIT websites. The reason we chose this method is because both the platforms are commonly accessed by RMIT students and enabled students to download the app easily to their mobile devices. For the RMIT website, we will publish a link to download an apk file, which is only usable for android users. Therefore, the App Store is also a crucial platform for our product publishing. However, the process that Google Play and App Store take to check our file integrity as well as bugs and viruses will take at least 3 months before allowing us to publish on the platform.</p>

                                    <hr class="name_line" style = "height:8px">
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/6.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Our group project idea has originated from our real-life experience as RMIT University first-year students and we are still new to the campus, especially the Saigon South campus with a tremendous acreage which can make newcomers like us get lost easily. Besides, since this is our first semester at RMIT University, we have noticed that the university’s operational mechanism is still a little incoherent to us and sometimes we still have difficulties in finding our classroom. Moreover, the timetable and the timeframe of our activities that we want to join are not assembled in one application which can make us feel a little confused since we have to get access to different applications and even to the web browser to find the information that we need, which can also be time-consuming. Therefore, with regard to new students, visitors, and guest lecturers who are yet familiar with the campus room layout, will suffer some problems with navigating the location that they want to go to, which can take a long time and they can be late for meetings. Hence, our group has come up with an application that will provide great support for RMIT University Saigon South campus students, lecturers, and visitors to enhance their experience. Generally, our free all-in-one application will help them to manage their timetable and meetings schedule with ease. In addition, it will prevent complicated and time-consuming procedures since most features in different applications and on the web browser that the RMIT University students, lecturers, and staff are using will be assembled into our application. As a result, our multifunctional application can be a turning point to make things more simple but more effective.
                                    <br><br>To complete this project with flying colors, HTML, CSS, Javascript and other programming languages like C, C++, Java, Dart, etc play a vital role in our application building process. Besides, we have to use additional tools for the design, the interface, the prototypes, managing the databases, etc. We also have to discuss with RMIT University Saigon South campus management for using the information of students, lecturers, and staff’s databases. In addition, we have to make our application run smoothly besides making it look eye-catching but not sophisticated.
                                    <br><br>First and foremost, before getting into any actual application constructing processes, competitive market research is considered one of the most important steps to make a successful application since there are a plethora of applications that are published daily, a lot of applications from famous technology companies. Therefore, researching about the market as well as the competitors can make our application more comprehensive and more demanding, which can help our application be more popular, the leaders in other RMIT University campuses can acknowledge the potential of our application and we can produce more revenue. Thong will search for all applications that share the same idea to our project before taking further research into those applications’ functionality and operating mechanism. Besides, Thong will do some research and analysis on the hot trends and concepts in the market at present to attract more potential investors. Thong also analyzes the users’ feedbacks from our competitors to know how well those applications meet the users’ needs to make our application more helpful and improve the users’ experience. Not only that but there will also be surveys sent to RMIT University students, staff, and lecturers for early feedbacks as well as suggestions, and Thong will analyze and summarize those surveys so that we can acknowledge any extra essential features that we can add to our application.
                                    <br><br>The second phase is the preparation for the application building process. Initially, we will carry out a group discussion to come up with more advanced and innovative ideas based on our original ideas to make our application stand out from the rest. In addition, Thong will analyze the early feedback and suggestions from the surveys that we have done and we will take them as advice and suggestions for us to complete our ideas about the features inside the application and make it more creative and comprehensive. Next, the name of the application is one of the most important aspects of making an application since it can also be a key to attracting more users. We have agreed that our application’s name should be simple but eye-catching and unique to leave a deep impression on the users and they can easily recognize and remember. Therefore, our application is called RMIT SGS, which is exclusively made for RMIT University Saigon South campus.
                                    <br><br>After that, we will transform from our complete ideas to features and functions. The first feature of our application is the login part for the ones having RMIT ID and the others. Considering RMIT University students, lecturers, and staff, who have already had the RMIT ID and passwords so they can use that to log in to our application and they can use all built-in features in it. Regarding visitors and guest lecturers, they can sign in as guests and they can only use the navigation, online health declaration, and performance feature.
                                    <br><br>The second feature is the navigation feature. In detail, it will comprise a search engine, wayfinding, zoom level, direction mode, QR code locators, and accessibility tools. “The search engine makes it easier to locate classrooms, restrooms, cafeterias, libraries, or other locations inside the campus. Aside from that, the wayfinding feature allows users to navigate their way around and between buildings, as well as locate any resources using its search and direction engine. Furthermore, the zoom level feature is used to display the map layers and places of interest at specific zoom ranges. Specifically, map details will display smoothly as the viewer zooms in, and the map only shows the most relevant points of interest when the viewer zooms out. Moreover, the direction mode feature provides you with routes to the place you want to go and also shows the time and distance to those places. Additionally, there is a QR code locators tool that allows users to locate themselves via scanning QR code stickers plastered across the campus. In particular, the program has an accessibility feature developed for people with reduced mobility by identifying places with ramps and elevators. To guarantee an ideal navigation experience, this app also marks particular regions as inaccessible, and the routing engine will omit these areas from route suggestions” [2, pp. 25-26]. In this feature, Luan will use map API tools like Google Map for outdoor maps and MapWiz for indoor maps for the virtual maps and we will use GPS technology to track the user’s current position on the campus and route suggestions on the virtual map depending on the distance and route availability.
                                    <br><br>The third feature is the social dashboard feature, which includes on-campus events and markers. “Firstly, the on-campus events feature allows people to create and display temporary maps, and points of interest added for special events like job fairs, open days, or people may use it to mark classes that correspond to their timetable. Besides, our application will also display a
                                    <br><br>personal timetable according to the RMIT ID that people use to sign in so that they will not struggle to find their timetables on Allocate+. Furthermore, the map highlights notable places such as cafes, restaurants, convenience stores, and libraries, which you can easily click to go there quickly or save to a preferred list” [2, pp. 26-27].
                                    <br><br>The next feature of the application is the online health declaration feature. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are safety protocols that must be followed, so this feature is made to keep RMIT students, lecturers, and staff safe from infection while on campus. “As students, we have experienced studying face-to-face on campus for a while and we have noticed a small but time-consuming issue. Every time students, lecturers, or visitors come to the RMIT campus, they all have to fill in the Health Declaration Form provided by RMIT University. However, after filling in the form on the university website, they have to wait for a period of time for the confirmation email on Outlook depending on their network connection, so it can take a long time if their connection is weak, which can be very uncomfortable and annoying. Students, lecturers, and visitors do not have to complete the form on the university website because they can fill in it and instantly receive the confirmation email in the RMIT SGS app. Since the security officers have to check the QR code of the Health Declaration Form, we have also replicated the form and the confirmation email like the former version on the university website so that people will not be confused” [2, pp. 27-28].
                                    <br><br>In addition, the RMIT SGS application also has some extra features. Firstly, there will be multilingual support for the vast majority of users, our application content can be switched between Vietnamese, English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean since these are popular languages and RMIT University is an international environment, so there are a lot of people from various countries and different cultures. Secondly, cross-platform support will also be available on the RMIT SGS app. Therefore, Apple, Android, and Windows-based devices can get access to our application. Additionally, the campus virtual map and route will be constantly updated since there will be some changes to the campus in the future and there will be a downloadable campus map for offline usage.
                                    <br><br>The third phase of the RMIT SGS application building process is making an outstanding marketing plan with decent strategies and an investment proposal to fund our application. Initially, Luan will be the Project Manager so he will be the representative of our team and he will bring into the discussion with RMIT University Saigon South campus management for permission, information databases and he will advertise and persuade how useful our application will be for RMIT students, lecturers and staff so that there will be potential investment from RMIT University Saigon South campus into our application. In addition, Luan will also look for sponsorship from other potential domestic and foreign investors.
                                    <br><br>After that, the fourth phase of the process is the technical-oriented tasks of constructing the code for the application and the interface design of the application. Having discussed this with the group, Thach will be the Software Security Engineer and the Back-end Developer of the RMIT SGS application. Thach will take care of the security of our application, information databases, and the server of our application. Since there are diverse types of malware and hackers, Thach will use various techniques in order to maintain the highest security level for the application, databases, and the server because they are very vulnerable. Thach will use different techniques like Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Database Security Scanning, Mobile Application Security Testing (MAST), and many more besides building firewalls and coming up with anti-malware solutions to keep our application safe and secure. Next, Ngoc will be the UI/UX developer of the RMIT SGS application. She will take care of designing wireframes and prototypes, information architect and Ngoc will help me with managing the databases. In addition, she will depend on the former analysis from Thong to build up the interaction part of our application to make our users feel comfortable and satisfied while interacting with our application. She will use XCode for building the RMIT SGS application for devices running Apple operating system and Android Studio for building our application for Android and Windows-based devices. In addition, Ngoc will develop the interactive elements of our application’s interface like menu bars, buttons, and many more together with design visual elements of our product like the fonts, colors, sizes, icons, and more. In addition, Ngoc will also depend on the former analysis from Thong to recognize the latest design trends and concepts to make our application more aesthetically satisfying. Ngoc will use Flutter, which is an open-source, cross-platform Software Development Kit (SDK) that allows all operating systems to share the same code, to build interactive elements in the interface. Plus, Ngoc will use a diversity of tools specialized for graphic designing such as Figma, Axure, Adobe XD, and many more to turn our application’s interface into a spectacular piece of artwork. Moreover, he will also do some further research into typography to make our application’s layout look more pleasing and comfortable for the users. During the process, Luan will be the Project Manager and he will deal with the paperwork as well as come up with a great marketing plan for our application and come up with some strategies in order to bring our application to the next level and attract more users.
                                    <br><br>The fifth phase of the RMIT SGS application constructing process is the testing and publication part. Thach and Ngoc will put all of our work together to make a beta version of our application, and then we will publish the beta version of our application for trail usage, application testing, and seeking for any errors. Furthermore, there will be a feedback part for the users, and Thong will analyze and summarize for Thach and Ngoc to amend our parts. After being upgraded and becoming a complete version of itself, Luan will contact CH Play, App Store, and Microsoft Store for the RMIT SGS application publication.
                                    <br><br>The final phase of our application building process is the adjust and improve part and this final phase is going to determine whether our application will attract more users or not. In this phase, Thong will analyze and summarize the feedback from the users via the ratings and the comments since our application is free and our revenue will depend on the number of downloads. After that, Thach, Ngoc, and Luan will continue to add new features and refresh our application’s layout design regularly so that the users can have excitement and satisfaction while using the RMIT SGS application and make our application more comprehensive. Ultimately, we will market our application for the highest exposure using marketing strategies that will create a significant and long-lasting impact. By doing this, directors of other RMIT University campuses or other universities can recognize the potential and the usefulness of our application and then they can invest in our work and we can extend our application to a larger scale. Potentially, there will be more RMIT University campus maps and even other universities’ maps updated so that our application can be more popular and our revenue will rise considerably.</p>

Thach will look at the profile and divide each person's role for the rest of the making phase. Luan will set the timeline and set goals for each step we need to achieve and Ngoc will do research and arrange for tools and equipment to be ready. After all the internal discussion and final draft we will propose to RMIT for the approval. When the school accepts our plan, we will start working on the prototype. Ngoc will be our UI/UX developer because with her deep background of UI interface and design she had accomplished before. Thach will be our back-end developer, software security engineer because he is familiar with SQL and this will aid him with experience for future data analyst. Luan is our project manager because he can . In our beta testing phase, Thong will set up and select people for testing and give feedback to our apps. Luan will gather all the feedback and relay all the bugs and problems to our back-end and front-end for debugging. We will repeat the process until everything works as it’s supposed to.</p>

Our navigation function operate similar to Google Maps, or like the navigation in the Disney World for their parks, the navigation will show the routes and time estimate arrival of each buildings and rooms, also shows cafeterias, convenience stores, and libraries, which you can easily click to go there quickly or save to a preferred list. With the Covid-19 pandemic still surging in numbers every single day, and RMIT dedication to return back to campus with high precaution. Daily Health Declaration form is a necessity for student and faculty members to  traverse around campus with clearance. The current method is a link to a Microsoft Office form using a web browser, our idea is to make the form integrate into the app and have the QR code for confirmation instantly, which is more time efficient and less complicated. Our third feature is a social dashboard, it’s a news and event locator that is currently happening around RMIT, including your classes calendar when you login. 
                                    <br><br>All the features mentioned is all of our core point of this project, however, given the time to show the proof of concept, we will focus on making the navigation feature work properly and the daily Health Declaration form as our main point, the social dashboard can as a later-on feature because it not necessary as the other two with the current situation. Also our plan of having multiple languages selection, for the time being it will only have English and Vietnamese based on the majority of students and faculty members.

Furthermore, as our project requires a lot of coding and designing that needs to have good collaboration between members, GitHub sure is the most important tool of our project in maintaining a good workflow.</p>

As our main target is students from RMIT, our app has to be able to run on several OS such as iOS, MacOS and Android. Therefore, for our app’s UI, we are going to use design tools such as Flutter, Figma (for all platform, browser base), InVision Studio and Axure (for designing), Adobe XD (for MacOS and iOS) and Sketch (for MacOS). These apps will be used by our designer, collaborating with our front-end developer to create the main interface of our app.</p>

To run our app on iOS and MacOS, we will use XCode as a developing tool. For Android, we will be using Android Studio as it is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system.</p>

Our map will consist of 2 views, the outdoor view, which is used for navigating around buildings and facilities of RMIT SGS campus. The second view will be the indoor map, which will be used for navigation inside buildings. The tools that we will use for the map will be Google Map and MapWiz for outdoor view and indoor view respectively.</p>

                                    <h5 style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px;">Phase 1:</h5>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">In Phase 1, our prototype will be tested by members in the team. The procedures will be: predicting target user’s needs, setting objectives, testing, fix and debug code. The procedures will be repeated until the app satisfies all the objectives. To be specific, each member of the team will think of what they will need from a navigation app as an RMIT student. After that, those needs will be listed out as the objectives that the app will aim to achieve. Then the app will be tested to see if it has satisfied the objectives. If there are any flaws that we find, we will have a discussion to see if any change is needed. Then the coding team will have to fix the problem or add-in some functionality for our app, we may even have to restructure our code if there are some major bugs or mistakes made in our code.</p>                                                                                                                                            
                                    <h5 style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px;">Phase 2:</h5>

We are going to recruit some volunteers to be the testers of our product. The reason we chose to do this is because even though we have tested everything by ourselves, there may still be some flaws that we have not noticed. Furthermore, the opinions sometimes are biased as we will have the mindset of a developer of that app when we are testing it. Therefore, the outsider, which is also the main target of ours, will be the perfect choice for the beta testing. The procedure of phase 2 will be: Testing, feedback, analyze, fixing. First, the volunteers will be handed our product and get to try, experience it for a period of time, then they will provide feedback of their thoughts about the product. The analyst of our team will analyze the feedback, stating out the problem we are facing and all the flaws that the testers have found. Finally, the coding team will fix the problems so that the outcome will be the best version of the app. Similar to Phase 1, the whole procedure will be repeated until there are no flaws left in our product.</p>

The challenges will always be there, one of them would be what programming language would be suitable for the app and each of the features presented, therefore, we will have many testing and optimization phases for the best result but it is time consuming. The second risk we will face is online collaboration due to Covid situation, we will sometime being disconnected and the progress can be suddenly slowed and drop moral in team member, so we will implement team building game online to have fun and relax, and conduct team meeting to make sure everyone is up to date with the current progress and new deadline. The lack of knowledge is our biggest problem since all of us in the beginning of IT programs, progress will dramatically slow down and sometime we will have to learn new things by ourselves. This increases the chance of us damaging equipment or can’t use the software needed for the project.</p>

Therefore, we extremely valued the communication and process in our team. Our team has been formed since before the beginning of the course. For that reason, our team members have found no difficulties communicating with each other as we have gotten to know each other very well. The communicating channel we are currently using is Facebook’s Messenger, where we held most of the online discussions. Moreover, we also held some meetings at RMIT SGS Campus for easier and quicker communication/discussion. As our last assignments are report and presentation, our group has decided to work on Google Doc, where we will put all of our research and writings so that our leader can gather all the information easier and put it in a final report. For the powerpoint presentation preparation, the designing process will take place on Google Slides so that the collaborative work will be conducted easier.</p>
